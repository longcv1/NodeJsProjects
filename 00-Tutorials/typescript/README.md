# TS with Express framework:
# 1. PROS:
#   - Addressing these types issues with TS can force us to write better code
# 2. CONS:
#   - TS alone cannot express what is going on in the JS world accurately (ex: middleware)
#   - TS is not always accurate
#   - Inputs to a server (or any program with external inputs) are not guaranteed to exist or correct type
